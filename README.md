# SCSS Practice Project

This project is designed as a practice environment for working with SCSS (Sass). It includes examples of using SCSS features such as variables, mixins, functions, nesting, partials, and more. The goal of this project is to improve skills in writing modular, reusable, and efficient CSS using SCSS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your local development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (installed globally via `npm`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhcuisine/scss-practice-project.git
   cd scss-practice-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start a local server to view the project and automatically compile SCSS into CSS.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For creating the structure of the project.
- **SCSS (Sass)** - For modular and maintainable styles.
- **Gulp** - For automating tasks like SCSS compilation and live reloading.
- **Node.js & NPM** - For managing dependencies.

---

## Features

- **Variables**: Define reusable values for colors, fonts, and sizes.
- **Mixins**: Use mixins for reusable chunks of code, like media queries and animations.
- **Nesting**: Organize styles hierarchically for better readability.
- **Partials**: Split SCSS into multiple files for modularization.
- **Functions**: Use SCSS functions for advanced styling capabilities.

---

## Usage

- **Compiling SCSS**: SCSS is compiled to CSS automatically using Gulp. You can manually compile SCSS by running:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **Development Mode**: To start a local server with live reloading, use:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
